# snake
This is an Implementation of the classic snake game.

# Prerequisites
1. Install node
2. Ensure that npm is in your path

# What Doesn't work
1. The code to handle the snake biting itself is not in place. Should not take much effort.
1. Also need to add buttons for mobile devices, because detecting keyboard events for this on mobile devices would be difficult.

# How to Run
1. git clone the repository -- *git clone https://github.com/ashishkumarshah/snake.git*
1. Run the command *npm install*
1. Run the command *npm run-script webpack*
1. Run the command *npm start*
